Moving In Thirds
================
Windows may also be resized between thirds using any of the shortcuts above. For example, to have a window resized between 1/3 and 2/3 of the left region of the screen simply activate the left half ⌥ ⌘← keyboard shortcut more than once. Each time the shortcut is activated Spectacle will move the window between 1/3, 2/3, and back to 1/2 of the left side of the screen. This feature also applies to the upper left, lower left, upper right, and lower right shortcuts.

Spectacle can also move windows between horizontal and vertical thirds of the screen. The ⌃⌥ → keyboard shortcut will move a window to the next third of the screen, starting with the horizontal third region on the left of the screen. ⌃⌥ ← will move a window to the previous third of the screen.

Resizing a window is just as easy. To make a window a bit larger use the ⌃⌥ ⇧→ keyboard shortcut; ⌃⌥ ⇧← can be used to make a window smaller. Spectacle will always attempt to maintain contact between the edges of a window and the edges of the screen when resizing.
