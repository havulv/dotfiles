# Dotfiles

Dotfiles for general applications.

## Structure

Each directory is named the same as the underlying dotfile directory,
with the next directory containing all relevant config files. This is
done so that when running [dotstow](./scripts/.scripts/dotstow) the
configuration files are properly symlinked into the `$HOME` directory.

There are some configuration files which are "incomplete" or have some
empty data in them. That is me trying to clean out secrets without
cleaning out all the configuration files. Ideally, this `.dotfiles` repo
is a direct reflection of the generalized state of the machine I
would ideally always like to use.

### Exceptions

TBD (the exceptions that are not included here and some of the reasons
for the specialized customization)

### Breakdown

TBD (a breakdown for each of the configuration files and directories)
